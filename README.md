#####Body#####

1. An Anſwer to the ſeverall Petitions of late exhibited
to the High Court of Parliament, And to his Excellency
the Lord Generall Cromwell, by the poor
Husbandmen, Farmers, and Tenants in ſeverall
Counties of England, for the taking away of Tithes
paid to Priests and Impropriators.

1. The Petitioners by that which hath been already declared
may eaſily diſcern, that there will be many ſufferers
and ſad loſers, if tithes impropriate ſhall be taken
away. In the next place it ſhall be diſcovered,
who they are that ſhall be the Gayners, when all
Lands are tithe-free.

1. The Petitioners are alike grieved with
the Ministers of the Goſpell for their
maintenance by tithes, As they are with Impropriators,
all muſt be taken away from them. It
being an eaſy matter, ſay they, to order a more honourable
maintenance for them. But in what way they declare
not. We ſhall not ſay any thing concerning the Miniſters
divine right to tithes; Nor of the conveniencie
thereof for their maintenance. We ſhall proceed in the
ſame way as before, and ſhew to the Petitioners their miſtakes in the Clergies Revenue; And in their own expectations.
